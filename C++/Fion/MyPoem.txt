"I cannot go to school today,"
Said little Peggy Ann McKay.
"I cannot go to school and pla'y!
I have the measles and the mumps,
A gash, a rash and purple bumps.
My mouth is wet, my throat is dry,
I’m going blind in my right eye.
My tonsils are as big as rocks,
asdf fdsa roll'd,
fdsa fdsa gol'd,
afs o'er
fsa o'er
I’ve counted sixteen chicken pox"
