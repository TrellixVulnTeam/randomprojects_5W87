The topic that I am passionate about are how videogames work. Pokémon is one of the earliest games that I ever played. I have fond memories of playing the game and learning how to read to better play the game. 

Pokémon is a relatively old game. It’s first generation was released sometime in 1999 in the United States. I thought that the game mechanics would be advanced enough for a challenge but still doable. In making the game I worked my way through battle mechanics, creating objects (well structs) and solving the problem of expandability. Currently I hardcoded each Pokémon into the game but if I had more time I may have been able to code in expandability through statistics files.  I am impressed that Nintendo could come up and release this game for a game console that has pitiable specifications by today’s standards.

The first expected input is for the user to type “new”. This can be typed at any point in the game to start a new game. After “new” the user is to pick a Pokémon. Only the first letter of the Pokémon is needed, case insensitive. After choosing a Pokémon, three commands are expected. Either to battle “battle <insert name of move>”, list available moves “moves”, or list Pokémon caught “pkmn”. The name of the move is case sensitive so listing available moves is expected for a first-time player. A player can attempt to catch the wild Pokémon by using “battle catch”. After death, success in defeating the wild Pokémon, or success in capture, the game resets, giving your Pokémon full HP and assigning another random wild Pokémon to face. Only three poke balls are given and there is no way to gain more poke balls.
